The Automated Intelligent Masking & Information Tool
(AIM-IT) is a novel author masking technique (AMT) that is an instance of a (1+3)
evolution strategy.

More information about AIM-IT can be found in its seminal publication 
"Towards a Human-AI Hybrid for Adversarial Authorship". If you have any questions
